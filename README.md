# Artic Network SARS-CoV-2 Analysis

Run the ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 methodology.



## Introduction

The wf-artic workflow implements a slightly modified ARTIC FieldBioinformatics
workflow for the purpose of preparing consensus sequences from SARS-CoV-2
genomes that have been DNA sequenced using a pooled tiling amplicon strategy.

The workflow consumes a folder containing demultiplexed sequence reads as
prepared by either MinKNOW or Guppy. The workflow needs to know the primer
scheme that has been used during genome amplification and library preparation
e.g. `ARTIC/V3` or `ONT_Midnight/V1`. Other parameters can be specified too e.g.
assign sample names to the barcodes or to adjust the length distribution of
acceptable amplicon sequences.




## Compute requirements

Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 4
+ Memory = 8GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 2
+ Memory = 4GB

Approximate run time: 5 minutes per sample

ARM processor support: False




## Install and run


These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line.
You can also access the workflow via the
[EPI2ME Desktop application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage
compute and software resources,
therefore Nextflow will need to be
installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html)
to provide isolation of the required software.
Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.
This is controlled by the
[`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles)
parameter as exemplified below.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository
in order to run the workflow.
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can
be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow.
This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of
Nextflow and provide a list of all parameters
available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-artic --help
```
To update a workflow to the latest version on the command line use
the following command:
```
nextflow pull epi2me-labs/wf-artic
```

A demo dataset is provided for testing of the workflow.
It can be downloaded and unpacked using the following commands:
```
wget https://ont-exd-int-s3-euwst1-epi2me-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/wf-artic/wf-artic-demo.tar.gz
tar -xzvf wf-artic-demo.tar.gz
```
The workflow can then be run with the downloaded demo data using:
```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-artic \
	--fastq 'wf-artic-demo/fastq' \
	--sample_sheet 'wf-artic-demo/sample_sheet.csv' \
	--scheme_name 'SARS-CoV-2' \
	--scheme_version 'Midnight-ONT/V3' \
	-profile standard
```

For further information about running a workflow on
the command line see https://labs.epi2me.io/wfquickstart/

## Input example

<!---Example of input directory structure, delete and edit as appropriate per workflow.--->
This workflow accepts FASTQ files as input.

The FASTQ input parameters for this workflow accept one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ files. In the first and second cases (i and ii), a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case (iii), the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`.

```
(i)                     (ii)                 (iii)

This parameter can be used to override the detected value (or to provide a model name if none was found in the inputs). However, users should only do this if they know for certain which model was used as selecting the wrong option might give sub-optimal results.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is largely a wrapper around the [Artic Network](https://artic.network/) [Field Bioinformatics](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) analysis package.

### 1. Concatenates input files and generate per read stats.

The [fastcat/bamstats](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/fastcat) tool is used to concatenate multifile samples to be processed by the workflow. It will also output per read stats including average read lengths and qualities. Reads are additionally filtered for sequence length and quality characteristics.

### 2. Mapping and primer trimming (Artic)

Concatenated reads are mapped to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2). A primer scheme-specific BED file is used to identify the regions of
the mapped sequences that correspond to synthetic sequences (primers) - these regions are clipped to ensure that sequences are entirely of biological origin.

### 3. Variant calling and consensus generation (Artic)

The retained sequences are used to prepare a consensus sequence that is then polished using [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) and variant calling is performed to produce a VCF file of genetic differences relative to the reference genome.

### 4. Lineage/clade assignment

The consensus sequence is annotated for virus clade information using [NextClade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/), and strain assignment is performed using [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin).



## Troubleshooting

+ If the workflow fails please run it with the demo data set to ensure the workflow itself is working. This will help us determine if the issue is related to the environment, input parameters or a bug.
+ See how to interpret some common nextflow exit codes [here](https://labs.epi2me.io/trouble-shooting/).
